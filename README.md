#### This repository contains all my work and projects of Data Analysis, Dashboarding, reporting and Development using Power BI. Throughout my Power BI journey, I hvae done various term and portfolio projects from different sectors i.e Business & Retail, Finance, Healthcare, Power & Energy etc.

## 1. Sales Analysis
This project is about a retail store having a chain of frenchises in various cities across country and the analysis conducted to improve the available payment options to customers for smooth purchase experience, and second to recognize those frenchises with less sales so that targeted campaigns can be carried out.

## 2. Customer Churn and Risk Value Analysis
This project is about predictive churn modeling to Identify at-risk customers before they churn, enabling proactive interventions and retention strategies, and second customer segmentation to group customers based on shared characteristics and churn risk, allowing for targeted marketing and engagement efforts.

## 3. Road Accidents Analysis
This project focuses on developing a UK road accident dashboard featuring primary KPIs such as total casualties and accidents with year-on-year growth, segmented by severity. Additionally, it includes secondary KPIs like casualties by vehicle type and monthly casualty trends. Utilizing DAX formulas, it calculates current year and year-on-year metrics for casualties and accidents, offering insights into road safety trends which facilitates informed decision-making for stakeholders.
